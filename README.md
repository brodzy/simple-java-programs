## CPU Scheduler:
Program simulating a simple CPU scheduler to evaluate, based on average waiting time, three CPU scheduling algorithms. Non-preemptive Shortest Job First, Non-preemptive Priority, and Round Robin.

## Multithread:
Program to find the row-major sorting of a given input file that contains rows of integers. Since each row is sorted independent of other rows, the sorting operation can happen simultaneously for all rows. Hence, multithreading is applicable.

## Synchronization:

## TCP Probe:
Program that processes TCP Probe Output (tcpprobe.dat) by separating the three TCP flows based on their source port numbers and exports them out into three separate files.
